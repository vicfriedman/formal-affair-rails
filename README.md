# Formal Affair

## Instructions

Three resources have been set up and each needs their own set of forms.

Run the tests and look in the "app/views" directory for where the forms
will live.

1. Babies
  - Use the form_for helper.

2. Concretes
  - Use the form_tag helper.

3. Searches
  - Use the HTML \<form\> tag.

Here's the [Rails Form Helper Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html).

Rails uses CSRF tokens in its forms
to defend against the [cross site request forgery
vulnerability] (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#csrf-countermeasures).

When you're not using a Rails form helper, you'll need to insert your
own CSRF token.
